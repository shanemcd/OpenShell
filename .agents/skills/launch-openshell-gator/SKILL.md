# Launch OpenShell Gator

Launch and supervise the repository's headless gator sandbox agent through OpenShell. This skill covers the operator workflow around `scripts/agents/run.sh`; the in-sandbox review and state-machine policy remains the `gator-gate` skill baked into the gator payload.

For gator's PR/issue validation policy, load `gator-gate` inside the launched sandbox. For generic sandbox CLI usage, use `openshell-cli`. For unhealthy gateways or sandbox startup failures, use `debug-openshell-cluster` after the launch preflight identifies a gateway/runtime problem.

## Non-Negotiable Rules

- Keep normal gator launches supervised: use `--watch --background` and let the in-sandbox supervisor own sleeping and relaunching bounded cycles.
- Do not add passive `sleep` loops in the operator session to watch gator. Check logs or status once, then report the current state or launch a proper watcher outside the model session only when explicitly asked.
- Do not use `--keep` for normal supervised gators. The launcher already keeps watch-mode sandboxes alive through the supervisor.
- Do not change the default gator model in `scripts/agents/gator/agent.yaml` for experiments. Use `CODEX_MODEL=...` and, if needed, a temporary `--from` Docker context or `--codex-bin` override.
- Do not push to contributor branches, approve, merge, post `/ok to test`, or broaden gator scope unless the operator explicitly authorized that action.
- Scope each launch prompt to the requested issue/PR set. Avoid repo-wide gator scans unless the operator asked for repo-wide processing.
- Treat `/etc/openshell/agent-payload` as immutable once a sandbox is created. After prompt/skill/runtime/image changes, delete and relaunch the affected gator instead of trying to patch files in-place.
- Leave unrelated local files alone, including `.opencode/` artifacts and old gator logs unless the user asks for cleanup.

## Key Paths

| Path | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `scripts/agents/run.sh` | Manifest-driven OpenShell agent launcher. |
| `scripts/agents/gator/agent.yaml` | Gator manifest: default gateway, harness, providers, runtime, skills, and subagents. |
| `scripts/agents/gator/Dockerfile` | Gator sandbox image source. Local launches build this image through OpenShell. |
| `scripts/agents/gator/policy.yaml` | Sandbox policy for the gator agent. |
| `scripts/agents/gator/bin/gh` | Gator-specific `gh` wrapper and same-SHA duplicate-post guard. |
| `scripts/agents/gator/prompts/gator.md` | Rendered top-level prompt template baked into the payload. |
| `scripts/agents/gator/skills/gator-gate/SKILL.md` | In-sandbox gator state-machine skill. |
| `scripts/agents/gator/logs/` | Background launch and supervisor logs. |

## Preflight

Run these checks before launching unless the operator asks for a best-effort launch.

### Step 1: Confirm Repository Root

```bash
git rev-parse --show-toplevel
git status --short --branch
```

Use the repository root as the working directory for all commands. A dirty worktree is allowed, but do not stage or modify unrelated files.

### Step 2: Verify Required Host Tools

```bash
command -v openshell
command -v gh
command -v jq
command -v ruby
```

The local `openshell` wrapper may recompile the CLI. If that fails, fix the local build or ask the operator before changing unrelated source.

### Step 3: Verify GitHub Auth

Use `gh api user` as the health check. It works with provider-scoped tokens and matches gator's own auth guidance.

```bash
gh api user --jq '.login'
gh api repos/NVIDIA/OpenShell --jq '{full_name,default_branch}'
```

If this fails, refresh host `gh` auth before launching. Do not rely on `gh auth status` alone inside provider-backed sandboxes.

### Step 4: Verify Codex Auth For Codex Harness

The default gator harness is Codex. Check that the host has usable Codex auth material:

```bash
jq -e '.tokens.access_token and .tokens.refresh_token and .tokens.account_id' "$HOME/.codex/auth.json" >/dev/null
```

If this fails, run the local Codex login flow outside the gator launch. If Codex was recently reauthenticated and gateway refresh fails later, relaunch with `--reset-refresh` once.

### Step 5: Verify Gateway Is Registered And Alive

Use the target gateway, usually `docker-dev` for local gators.

```bash
openshell --gateway docker-dev status
openshell --gateway docker-dev sandbox list
```

Expected result: status returns successfully and sandbox listing completes. If the gateway is unreachable, the runtime cannot create sandboxes, or sandbox listing hangs, switch to `debug-openshell-cluster` and fix the gateway before launching gator.

### Step 6: Check Existing Gator Sandboxes

Avoid duplicate gators for the same PR unless intentionally replacing a stuck or stale one.

```bash
openshell --gateway docker-dev sandbox list
```

Look for names like `gator-pr-<number>-supervised`. If one exists, inspect its log before deleting or relaunching.

## Input Normalization

Never paste raw operator text into shell arguments such as `--name`, `--from`, issue numbers, or PR numbers. Normalize values before constructing launch commands.

Use digits only for issue and PR numbers:

```bash
pr_number="<digits-only>"
[[ "$pr_number" =~ ^[0-9]+$ ]] || { echo "invalid PR number" >&2; exit 1; }
```

Use a restricted sandbox-name character set:

```bash
sandbox_name="gator-pr-${pr_number}-supervised"
[[ "$sandbox_name" =~ ^[A-Za-z0-9_.-]+$ ]] || { echo "invalid sandbox name" >&2; exit 1; }
```

For local image contexts passed to `--from`, use an agent-created path such as `mktemp -d`; do not pass raw user-supplied paths without validating that they are expected local Dockerfile contexts.

## Standard Launches

### Launch A PR Watcher

Use a stable, scoped name and a prompt that names exactly what gator should do.

```bash
pr_number="<digits-only>"
[[ "$pr_number" =~ ^[0-9]+$ ]] || { echo "invalid PR number" >&2; exit 1; }
sandbox_name="gator-pr-${pr_number}-supervised"
[[ "$sandbox_name" =~ ^[A-Za-z0-9_.-]+$ ]] || { echo "invalid sandbox name" >&2; exit 1; }

./scripts/agents/run.sh \
  --agent gator \
  --gateway docker-dev \
  --name "$sandbox_name" \
  --watch \
  --background \
  "Review and monitor PR #${pr_number} through the gator-gate workflow. Scope this invocation only to PR #${pr_number}."
```

The launcher builds the gator sandbox image when needed, stages the immutable payload, imports provider profiles, configures provider credentials and refresh, creates the sandbox, and writes a background log under `scripts/agents/gator/logs/`.

### Launch An Issue Or Issue/PR Pair

```bash
issue_number="<digits-only>"
[[ "$issue_number" =~ ^[0-9]+$ ]] || { echo "invalid issue number" >&2; exit 1; }
sandbox_name="gator-issue-${issue_number}-supervised"
[[ "$sandbox_name" =~ ^[A-Za-z0-9_.-]+$ ]] || { echo "invalid sandbox name" >&2; exit 1; }

./scripts/agents/run.sh \
  --agent gator \
  --gateway docker-dev \
  --name "$sandbox_name" \
  --watch \
  --background \
  "Run gator on issue #${issue_number}. Scope this invocation only to issue #${issue_number}."
```

For a linked pair:

```bash
pr_number="<digits-only>"
issue_number="<digits-only>"
[[ "$pr_number" =~ ^[0-9]+$ ]] || { echo "invalid PR number" >&2; exit 1; }
[[ "$issue_number" =~ ^[0-9]+$ ]] || { echo "invalid issue number" >&2; exit 1; }
sandbox_name="gator-pr-${pr_number}-supervised"
[[ "$sandbox_name" =~ ^[A-Za-z0-9_.-]+$ ]] || { echo "invalid sandbox name" >&2; exit 1; }

./scripts/agents/run.sh \
  --agent gator \
  --gateway docker-dev \
  --name "$sandbox_name" \
  --watch \
  --background \
  "Review and monitor PR #${pr_number} with linked issue #${issue_number} through the gator-gate workflow. Scope this invocation only to PR #${pr_number} and issue #${issue_number}."
```

### Launch With Explicit Maintainer Authorization

Only include authorization in the prompt when the operator explicitly gave it.

```bash
pr_number="<digits-only>"
[[ "$pr_number" =~ ^[0-9]+$ ]] || { echo "invalid PR number" >&2; exit 1; }
sandbox_name="gator-pr-${pr_number}-supervised"
[[ "$sandbox_name" =~ ^[A-Za-z0-9_.-]+$ ]] || { echo "invalid sandbox name" >&2; exit 1; }

./scripts/agents/run.sh \
  --agent gator \
  --gateway docker-dev \
  --name "$sandbox_name" \
  --watch \
  --background \
  "Review and monitor PR #${pr_number} through the gator-gate workflow. Scope this invocation only to PR #${pr_number}. The operator explicitly authorizes applying the test:e2e label and posting /ok to test for the current head SHA if gator determines that is required."
```

## Model Or Image Experiments

Use environment overrides. Do not edit `agent.yaml` for temporary experiments.

```bash
pr_number="<digits-only>"
[[ "$pr_number" =~ ^[0-9]+$ ]] || { echo "invalid PR number" >&2; exit 1; }
sandbox_name="gator-pr-${pr_number}-gpt56sol-supervised"
[[ "$sandbox_name" =~ ^[A-Za-z0-9_.-]+$ ]] || { echo "invalid sandbox name" >&2; exit 1; }

CODEX_MODEL=gpt-5.6-sol \
./scripts/agents/run.sh \
  --agent gator \
  --gateway docker-dev \
  --name "$sandbox_name" \
  --watch \
  --background \
  "Review and monitor PR #${pr_number} through the gator-gate workflow. Scope this invocation only to PR #${pr_number}. This launch is intentionally testing Codex model gpt-5.6-sol via the CLI launcher."
```

If the installed Codex CLI is too old for a model, create a temporary copy of `scripts/agents/gator/`, adjust only that temporary Dockerfile, and launch with that generated context. Keep the repo Dockerfile unchanged unless the version bump is the intended code change.

Example shape:

```bash
pr_number="<digits-only>"
[[ "$pr_number" =~ ^[0-9]+$ ]] || { echo "invalid PR number" >&2; exit 1; }
sandbox_name="gator-pr-${pr_number}-gpt56sol-supervised"
[[ "$sandbox_name" =~ ^[A-Za-z0-9_.-]+$ ]] || { echo "invalid sandbox name" >&2; exit 1; }
tmp_context="$(mktemp -d "${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/gator-codex-XXXXXX")"
cp -R scripts/agents/gator/. "$tmp_context"/

CODEX_MODEL=gpt-5.6-sol \
./scripts/agents/run.sh \
  --agent gator \
  --gateway docker-dev \
  --name "$sandbox_name" \
  --from "$tmp_context" \
  --watch \
  --background \
  "Review and monitor PR #${pr_number} through the gator-gate workflow. Scope this invocation only to PR #${pr_number}."
```

## Monitoring

### Read The Launch Result

The launcher prints the log path when `--background` is used:

```text
Started in background. Log: scripts/agents/gator/logs/<sandbox-name>.log
```

Read that file directly. Important markers:

- `Built image ...` means the local image build completed.
- `Created sandbox: <name>` means OpenShell accepted the sandbox.
- `openshell-agent: starting watch cycle` means the in-sandbox supervisor began a bounded cycle.
- `OpenAI Codex v...` plus `model: ...` confirms the Codex CLI and model actually used.
- `OPENSHELL_AGENT_RESULT {...}` is the bounded-cycle sentinel. In watch mode, the supervisor sleeps and relaunches after this line.
- `openshell-agent: still running watch cycle ...` is a heartbeat during long active model cycles.

### Inspect Active Sandboxes

```bash
openshell --gateway docker-dev sandbox list
openshell --gateway docker-dev sandbox get <sandbox-name>
```

If `sandbox get` is not supported by the local CLI shape, use `openshell sandbox --help` and follow the current command help.

### Interpret Common Sentinels

| Sentinel | Meaning | Operator action |
|---|---|---|
| `status=waiting` | Normal watch wait. | Leave sandbox running. |
| `status=blocked` | Human/process blocker. | Read reason; decide whether a human action is needed. |
| `status=transient_failure` | Retryable infrastructure/auth/transport issue. | Let supervisor retry unless repeated failures hit the configured cap. |
| `status=terminal_failure` | Unrecoverable agent failure. | Inspect log and fix/relaunch. |
| `status=complete` | Target closed, merged, or one-shot complete. | Delete sandbox if no longer needed. |

## Restarting A Gator

Restart when the payload must change, the sandbox is wedged without a sentinel, the model/tooling version changed, or a transient failure repeats past the useful retry point.

Before deleting, check that the sandbox is truly stale or that the operator asked for a restart. If a bounded review cycle is actively running and still producing useful output, prefer leaving it alone.

```bash
sandbox_name="<safe-sandbox-name>"
[[ "$sandbox_name" =~ ^[A-Za-z0-9_.-]+$ ]] || { echo "invalid sandbox name" >&2; exit 1; }

openshell --gateway docker-dev sandbox delete "$sandbox_name"
./scripts/agents/run.sh \
  --agent gator \
  --gateway docker-dev \
  --name "$sandbox_name" \
  --watch \
  --background \
  "<same scoped operator prompt, updated only with the reason for relaunch>"
```

When relaunching after a same-SHA infrastructure failure, say that the prior attempt failed before producing a valid review disposition. When relaunching after a draft-only blocker cleared, say that the prior same-SHA disposition was only a draft blocker and the PR is now ready for review.

## Troubleshooting

### Gateway Unreachable

Symptoms: `openshell status` fails, `sandbox list` fails, sandbox remains pending, image build never starts.

Action: load `debug-openshell-cluster` and diagnose the gateway/driver. Do not keep retrying gator launches against a dead gateway.

### Image Build Failure

Symptoms: Dockerfile step failure, missing package, incompatible Codex CLI, registry pull failure.

Actions:

- Confirm the build context is `scripts/agents/gator/` or the intended temporary `--from` context.
- Confirm Docker or the selected gateway runtime can pull `nvcr.io/nvidia/base/ubuntu:noble-20251013`.
- For Codex CLI version experiments, adjust a temporary Docker context first.
- Do not commit Dockerfile version changes unless the repo should permanently use that version.

### Provider Or Credential Failure

Symptoms: host `gh` auth fails, Codex refresh fails, in-sandbox GitHub calls report auth failures, `reviewer_subagent_failed` repeats due Codex auth.

Actions:

- Re-run the GitHub and Codex preflight checks.
- If host Codex auth changed, relaunch with `--reset-refresh` once.
- If Entra or Microsoft auth is involved in a future provider, use the relevant auth skill. Gator's default providers are GitHub and Codex.

### Unsupported `gh pr view --json` Field

Gator may recover by using supported `gh pr view` fields plus REST calls. If it does not, patch the gator prompt or skill to avoid the unsupported field, validate, commit, and relaunch with the updated payload.

### Same-SHA Duplicate Guard Blocks A Needed Comment

The wrapper intentionally blocks duplicate same-head-SHA gator dispositions. A relaunch should not post again for the same SHA unless one of these applies:

- Maintainer explicitly requests a same-SHA public response.
- The PR is merged or closed and needs terminal cleanup.
- The earlier attempt failed before posting.
- The prior marked disposition was only a reviewer infrastructure failure.
- The prior marked disposition was only a draft blocker and the PR is now ready for review.

Do not bypass with `OPENSHELL_GATOR_ALLOW_SAME_SHA_COMMENT=1` unless the operator explicitly confirms a maintainer override.

## Reporting Back

When you launch or inspect gator, report:

- Sandbox name.
- Gateway name.
- Log path.
- Target issue/PR scope.
- Harness and model when relevant.
- Whether image build and sandbox creation succeeded.
- Latest sentinel or heartbeat status.
- Any human action needed.

Keep the report concise. Include exact commands only when they help the operator reproduce or continue the workflow.
